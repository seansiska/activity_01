# Installing Software and Working Maze Solution Instructions

## Names of students in your group

**Your Name**: Sean Siska
**Partners Name**: Kati Boidock 

### Instructions

Please use clear and meaningful language to respond to each of the following questions. Be specific and concise in your answers.

As you work through the questions, please replace the To-Do's text with your answer. Otherwise the *Gatorgrade* (the automatic assignment checker) will complain that questions have not been answered in your activity.

All submissions for this activity are to be made via GitHub. Please also submit your work with a minimum of five (5) commits to your repository. (Note: These five commits are to encourage good habits when using `Git` and `GitHub`.)

## Part 1

Q1: List the tools you installed.

For this class I didnt install any tools onto my laptop because all the tools weve gone over in class I previously installed from my computer science class last semester.

Q2: Did you encounter any issues during the installation process? If so, how did you resolve them?

None, answered in the last question.

Q3: For each of the software tools you installed, describe its purpose and provide one feature that you find particularly useful or exciting about it.

Although I did not install anything, im going to list some of the tools and describe it.

GitHub - The online repository software that we can submit our work to in order to get it graded and show completion. Im excited to keep using this software because this is the same software that major companies use.

Pip - This software allows our professor to grade our code and work easily. Im excited to use this because it is developed by allegheny students.

Q4: How do you plan to use these tools in your future programming projects?

I plan to use GitHub to submit and turn in my code and reflections that ive completed, and at the same time using the GatorGrade that is being used because I installed the Pip software.

## Part 2

## Reflection: Maze and Instruction-Writing Activity

Please answer the following questions thoughtfully using **clear and meaningful** language. These questions are to help you to reflect on the activity that you just completed using mazes and the solution instructions that your wrote. These questions aim to connect the maze activity to writing computer code, in addition to the importance of writing clear and precise instructions for a computer to follow.

Q5: Which maze (filename) did you choose to solve?

I chose to solve the sigma_02.png file maze.

Q5: Which maze (filename) did your partner choose to solve?

my partner chose to do the rectangular_03.png.

Q6: To write the instructions to get through the maze, a type of language was necessary. What type of language did you use to write your instructions? For instance, was your selection a natural (human) language, or a more formalized language using some type of symbolic code?

My language was a normal human language, that consisted of a start position and facing direction, and then movements followed by change in direction. 

Q7. How did using this language work or not work to precisely convey your maze-solving instructions?

I think that my language works perfectly, it begins with a start location and a direction that you should be facing, then each step afterwards is a movement X amount of units and a direction you should be facing, a number on a standart 12 hour clock.

Q8: When you followed your partner group's instructions to solve their maze, did you encounter any steps that were unclear or ambiguous? How did you handle these situations, and what does this reveal about the importance of precision in instructions?

TODO

Q9: If you made a mistake or got stuck while following the instructions, what was the cause? Was it due to an error in the instructions, a misunderstanding, or something else? How does this relate to errors that can occur when a computer runs source code?

TODO 

Q10: Imagine a computer following your group's instructions exactly as written, without any ability to guess or improvise. Would the computer be able to solve the maze successfully? Why or why not?

TODO

Q11: How did you decide what details to include or leave out when writing your own instructions? What challenges did you face in making your instructions both complete and easy to follow?

TODO

Q12: Please place your maze solution "code" below.
