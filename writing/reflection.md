## Part 2

## Reflection: Maze and Instruction-Writing Activity

Please answer the following questions thoughtfully using **clear and meaningful** language. These questions are to help you to reflect on the activity that you just completed using mazes and the solution instructions that your wrote. These questions aim to connect the maze activity to writing computer code, in addition to the importance of writing clear and precise instructions for a computer to follow.

Q5: Which maze (filename) did you choose to solve?

TODO

Q5: Which maze (filename) did your partner choose to solve?

TODO

Q6: To write the instructions to get through the maze, a type of language was necessary. What type of language did you use to write your instructions? For instance, was your selection a natural (human) language, or a more formalized language using some type of symbolic code?

TODO

Q7. How did using this language work or not work to precisely convey your maze-solving instructions?

TODO

Q8: When you followed your partner group's instructions to solve their maze, did you encounter any steps that were unclear or ambiguous? How did you handle these situations, and what does this reveal about the importance of precision in instructions?

TODO

Q9: If you made a mistake or got stuck while following the instructions, what was the cause? Was it due to an error in the instructions, a misunderstanding, or something else? How does this relate to errors that can occur when a computer runs source code?

TODO

Q10: Imagine a computer following your group's instructions exactly as written, without any ability to guess or improvise. Would the computer be able to solve the maze successfully? Why or why not?

TODO

Q11: How did you decide what details to include or leave out when writing your own instructions? What challenges did you face in making your instructions both complete and easy to follow?

TODO

Q12: Please place your maze solution "code" below.
